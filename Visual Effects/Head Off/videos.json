    "prompt": "A fashion-forward young man stands against a vivid orange backdrop, dressed in a black varsity jacket with bold white patches reading “1996” and “1902–2022.” His braids are neatly styled in geometric patterns. With a slow, unsettling motion, he begins to lift his own head upward by the sides, as if detaching it from his body. As his head rises slightly, a gaping void is revealed where his neck should be — deep, black, and surreal. The orange background glows ominously around him, heightening the surreal and haunting contrast of this impossible act."

    "prompt": "Suddenly, he abruptly bends his elbows outward and grips the back of his head with both bare hands—fingers splayed across the smooth curve of his skull, thumbs pressing at the base, other fingers clenching the sides—then pulls his head straight up, making it the focal point of the frame."

    "prompt": "A woman stands confidently at a retro night market stall under glowing neon lights, dressed in a futuristic streetwear look: a cropped black tank top with hybrid sports logos, a ribbed electric-blue micro skirt with a white daisy patch, matching over-the-knee socks, and stiletto heels. Her face is partially obscured by a vivid blue knit balaclava, and her bare arms shimmer slightly under the hard artificial light. The background is cluttered with faded magazine covers, vinyls, worn wood, and old posters, bathed in deep red and cyan light trails from passing cars. With both hands she grabs her hair at the roots and lifts her head straight up, holding it above her shoulder, while a void gapes where her neck should be. Framed as a mid shot, slightly low angle, with harsh cinematic night lighting and sharp neon highlights. Focus on the glossy ribbed texture of her skirt, the stretch of her socks, the glint of her bracelet, and the cracked surfaces of the kiosk around her. The surreal action should feel seamlessly embedded in this chaotic but controlled urban aesthetic — a digital dream soaked in midnight color."

    "prompt": "A young man sits casually on a lush green hillside, surrounded by dense clover and blooming white wildflowers. He wears a pastel gradient sweatshirt and matching shorts, shifting smoothly from lavender to sky blue to soft pink, paired with crisp white sneakers. His relaxed posture contrasts with his focused gaze directed off-camera. Sunlight falls gently over the landscape, highlighting the rich textures of the grass and the smooth cotton of his outfit. With both hands he grabs his hair at the roots and lifts his head straight up, holding it above his shoulder, while a void gapes where his neck should be. Framed as a mid shot, slightly overhead, bathed in bright natural daylight. Focus on the subtle sheen of the fabric, the grass texture beneath him, the vibrant clover field, and the matte finish of his shoes. The peaceful summer setting is subtly interrupted by the surreal act, creating an uncanny sense of stillness and wonder."

    "prompt": "In a vintage bus adorned with pale green seats and soft natural light filtering through curved windows, a young woman in a pastel pink wool coat exhibits poised grace, her arms resting on the back of the mint seat ahead. Her striking blue eyes fixate on the camera, conveying an air of calm yet inscrutable depth. Slowly, she lifts her arms, fingers threading behind her head in a relaxed yet deliberate gesture. With a subtle movement, her head rises straight upward, creating a surreal moment as it separates cleanly from her body. The atmosphere remains still, enhancing the ethereal quality of her presence, bathed in soft, diffused light that accentuates the pastel tones around her."

    "prompt": "A serene young man stands perfectly still in the middle of a sunlit green field beneath a blue sky dotted with soft clouds. He wears a brown striped button-up shirt, a dark green velvet sweater tied around his shoulders, and a blue plaid cap labeled “TOURIST.” His posture is calm, hands in pockets, with a composed expression. Suddenly, he abruptly bends his elbows outward and grips the back of his head with both bare hands—fingers splayed across the smooth curve of his skull, thumbs pressing at the base of his skull, other fingers clenching the sides—then pulls his head straight up, making it the focal point of the frame. A void gapes where his neck should be."

    "prompt": "A young man with perfectly braided cornrows and diamond studs stands against a seamless green backdrop, wearing a green varsity jacket embroidered with bold white patches and symbols. His intense gaze cuts through the frame, unmoving and calculated. Without warning, he bends his elbows outward and grips the back of his head with both bare hands—fingers splayed across the smooth curve of his skull, thumbs pressing firmly at the base, other fingers clenching the sides—then pulls his head straight up in a clean motion, lifting it from his body like it's weightless. His head floats just above the neckline of his jacket, becoming the new focal point of the frame. A void gapes where his neck should be, silent and unreal. Camera language: eye-level portrait, sharp center framing, locked shot with subtle push-in. Atmosphere: surreal and suspended, controlled tension. Styling: 90s prep-athletic aesthetic, deep greens and neutral tones, minimal studio lighting."

    "prompt": "A tall blonde woman stands in a field of golden wildgrass during sunset, framed against the glowing skyline of a distant city. She wears a sculptural oversized chocolate-brown leather suit, its glossy texture catching the warm light. Her hands are deep in her pockets, and the exaggerated shoulders of the blazer give her a commanding, statuesque silhouette. Her long hair is softly tousled by the breeze, backlit by the low sun hanging behind her. With both hands she grabs her hair at the roots and lifts her head straight up, holding it above her shoulder, while a void gapes where her neck should be. Framed as a mid shot, eye-level, in warm hard backlight from the setting sun, creating rim highlights along her suit’s sharp edges. Focus on the shine and creases in the leather fabric, the tall dry grass catching golden hues, and the glowing sky that transitions from gold to dusty blue. The surreal effect of the detached head should appear stark and serene against the rich, cinematic dusk."

    "prompt": "Subject: A bold young woman with long dark hair, standing confidently on a truck step. She wears a vivid oversized red graphic T-shirt with black lettering, a tiered cream lace skirt, and chunky black combat boots. Her pose is relaxed yet powerful, with a slightly tilted head and confident gaze. Scene: Urban alleyway next to an open truck, with neutral-toned residential buildings and parked vehicles in the background. The setting feels gritty and authentic. Motion: An explosion of wild and elegant flowers begins to bloom across her body. Roses, lilies, poppies, and jasmine wrap around her arms, weave through the lace layers of her skirt, and sprout along her boots. Petals emerge from her shirt sleeves and spill down the fabric, while clusters of flowers nestle in her hair and around her neckline like natural jewelry. A few blossoms trail off behind her onto the metallic truck platform. Camera Language: Three-quarter body shot, slightly low angle to emphasize her strength and stature. Natural daylight with soft shadows enhances the vibrancy of the flowers. Atmosphere: Bold and surreal, a collision of edgy streetwear and blooming nature. The floral overlay contrasts beautifully with her strong presence, transforming the scene into a moment of wild beauty. Styling: Floral surrealism with street-style fusion — ultra-detailed blossoms in reds, whites, and greens, integrated seamlessly with the outfit’s texture. The lace captures the petals delicately, while the red T-shirt provides striking contrast to the organic forms. The overall aesthetic is expressive, vibrant, and rebellious."

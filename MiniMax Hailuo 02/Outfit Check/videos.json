    "prompt": "Camera frames a full-body view of a young man standing in a modern, minimalist office space, illuminated by soft daylight filtering through blinds. He wears rectangular black glasses, a burnt orange button-up shirt over a black and white layered tee, cream wide-leg trousers, and sleek black shoes. In his right hand, he holds a closed book gently by his side. The room features gray carpet, a light gray filing cabinet with a small stack of notebooks on top, and a taped paper on the white wall, all subtly casting soft shadows. The subject gracefully rotates 360 degrees around his vertical axis, feet planted firmly, moving smoothly and naturally without abrupt shifts. The orange shirt ripples gently around his torso and arms, reflecting light variances, while his hair subtly shifts with the rotation. Shadows and reflections adjust seamlessly on the filing cabinet and floor carpet, enhancing spatial depth. As the rotation concludes, he returns to the initial position, facing the viewer with calm confidence, embodying poised stillness amid a serene, softly lit work environment. Ambient sounds of soft air and gentle clothing rustle underscore the quiet scene."

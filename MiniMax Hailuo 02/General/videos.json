    "prompt": "The scene starts with a smooth steadicam shot at knee level, gliding toward the subject from the side and circling gently around her. She is a woman with long, curly dark hair, seated on the ground wearing a vintage red-and-black Opel football jersey and black shorts. The environment is sharply illuminated by one harsh light source, casting deep shadows that isolate her silhouette against a dark, nondescript background and concrete floor. Without moving her mouth, she silently adjusts her position by shifting her weight from one hand to the other, her hair swaying slightly with the motion. The steadicam fluidly rises to a medium close-up as she leans forward and brushes a loose strand of hair away from her face, locking eyes with the camera with an intense, curious gaze. The camera smoothly tracks her hands as she pushes herself into a low crouch, then floats around to reveal her profile as she takes a slow, calm breath. The overall feel is intimate and dynamic, with the steadicam movement precise and weightless, capturing her every silent movement with cinematic clarity and natural grace."
